   <a></a><h3>ABOUT : </h3></a>
   <p>
       Pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Engineering at Government Engineering College Bikaner, I've discovered a deep-seated interest in data science. My coding journey has been a winding road, marked by both successes and setbacks. While I've always had a knack for mathematics, logic building has occasionally thrown me for a loop. My lack of enthusiasm for web and android development has allowed me to channel my energy wholeheartedly into data science, machine learning, and related mathematical concepts like probability and linear algebra. I'm fascinated by the ability to translate abstract mathematical ideas into tangible solutions that have a real impact on the world. My foray into data science began in the fourth semester of my second year, after initially delving into web development and data structures and algorithms. However, upon encountering Python and machine learning algorithms, I embarked on a journey that has led me to this field.
